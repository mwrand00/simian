# simian

Simian is programming language based on the Monkey scripting language of Thorsten Ball's **Writing and Interpreter in Go**.  At present Simian is based so closely on Monkey as to be synonymous, but some changes in concrete syntax (and, possible, semantics) are expected to arise over time as I tinker with it.
