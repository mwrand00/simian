# simian

Simian is programming language based on the Monkey scripting language of Thorsten Ball's *Writing an Interpreter in Go*.  

At present Simian is based so closely on Monkey as to be identical, but some changes in concrete syntax (and, possibly, its operational semantics and/or implementation) are expected to arise over time as I tinker with it.  This is a project for me to learn about the Go programming language and some other things about compiler internals.
